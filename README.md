# CMPT432_Compiler_Design


Dear Alan: grade the main branch

# In this course I strive to:
* Gain and demonstrate an understanding of the fundamental areas of compiler
architecture: front end, intermediate representation, and the back end.
* Gain and demonstrate an understanding of context-free grammars and their use.
* Gain and demonstrate an understanding of the techniques for scanning (lexical
analysis), parsing a grammar, translation, and simple code generation.
* Embrace the opportunity to develop a complex system over the course of the
semester where I have to either live with my prior mistakes and shortcuts or go
back and fix them. (Either will teach valuable lessons.) 
* Learn that developing the software is only half the battle, debugging and testing are
critical skills for a talented professional, and skills that will be valuable. 
* Gain and demonstrate an understanding that the chasm between programs that
work once and programs that work every time is ridiculously huge.
* Enhance my continuing education skills. Capable problem solvers never stop
learning.
